# Tailwind CSS Setup Examples

A repository of examples showing how to setup Tailwind in a variety of different frameworks and environments.

## Available Examples

- [vue-cli](examples/vue-cli)
- [drupal](examples/drupal)

## Requested Examples

If you are experienced with any of these frameworks, we'd love a PR that includes a barebones example of the best way to set up Tailwind in that environment.

Please include instructions for the setup process as well, so it's easier for others to follow. [Here's an example](examples/vue-cli/README.md).

If we're missing you're favorite framework, don't hesitate to PR that either!
